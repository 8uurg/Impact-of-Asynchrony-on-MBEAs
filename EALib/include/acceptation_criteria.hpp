/**
 * @brief An acceptation criterion wrapping an arbitrary function.
 *
 * Useful for calling things from python, or, for testing.
 *
 * The function should adhere to the following properties:
 * - If a is better than b, 1 should be returned.
 * - If b is better than a, 2 should be returned.
 * - If a and b are equally good, 3 should be returned (1 | 2)
 * - If a and b are incomparable -- neither is strictly better than the other, 0 should be returned.
 *
 * Note that some components require a full ordering, if the criterion provided does not adhere to
 * this property, the behavior of these operators may be undefined.
